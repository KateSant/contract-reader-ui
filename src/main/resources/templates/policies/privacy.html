    <h3>Third-party links</h3>
    <p>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or
        enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these
        third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we
        encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>
    <h2>2. The data we collect about you</h2>
    <p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be
        identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
    <p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together
        as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class=“legal-concept”>Identity Data</span> includes first name, last name, username or similar
            identifier.
        </li>
        <li><span class=“legal-concept”>Contact Data</span> includes email address and telephone numbers.</li>
        <li><span class=“legal-concept”>Technical Data</span> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data,
            browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating
            system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.
        </li>
        <li><span class=“legal-concept”>Profile Data</span> includes your username and password, your preferences,
            configurations, feedback and survey responses.
        </li>
        <li><span class=“legal-concept”>Usage Data</span> includes information about how you use our website, products
            and services.

            marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.

    </ul>
    <p>We also collect, use and share <span class=“legal-concept”>Aggregated Data</span> such as statistical or
        demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered
        personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may
        aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if
        we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify
        you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We do not collect any <span class=“legal-concept”>Special Categories of Personal Data</span> about you (this
        includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation,
        political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor
        do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>
    <h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>
    <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to
        provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into
        with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or
        service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time. </p>
    <h2>3. How is your personal data collected?</h3>
        <p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>
        <ul>

                create an account on our website; subscribe to our service or publications; request marketing to be sent
                to you; enter a competition, promotion or survey; or give us feedback or contact us.

                browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs and other
                similar technologies. Please see our cookie policy for further details.
            </li>
            <li><span class=“legal-concept”>Third party </span>. We will receive Identity and Contact Data from third
                party authentication service providers such as Google which you use to log in to Contract Hub.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. How we use your personal data</h2>
        <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data
            in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
            <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and
                fundamental rights do not override those interests.
            </li>
            <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        </ul>

            process your personal data.</p>

        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and
            advertising.</p>
        <h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
        <p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may
            want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers
            may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). </p>
        <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased
            services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
        <h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
        <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing
            purposes. </p>
        <h3>Opting out</h3>
        <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the
            website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the
            opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time. </p>
        <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us
            as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other
            transactions.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access
            cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become
            inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our cookie
            policy.</p>
        <h3>Change of purpose </h3>
        <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider
            that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you
            wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original
            purpose, please contact us. </p>
        <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the
            legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
        <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the
            above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
        <h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
        <p>We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes described above with the
            following parties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
            <li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy,
                banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.
            </li>
            <li>Third party authentication service providers such as Google which you use to log in to Contract Hub.
            </li>
            <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets.
                Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our
                business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy
                policy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with
            the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes
            and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our
            instructions.</p>
        <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
        <p>Some of our external third party service providers may be based outside the UK so their processing of your
            personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK. </p>
        <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded
            to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level
                of protection for personal data.
            </li>
            <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which
                give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your
            personal data out of the UK. </p>
        <h2>7. Data security</h2>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
            lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
            personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
            know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality. </p>
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
        <h3>How long will we use your personal data for?</h3>
        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we
            collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
            reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or
            if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and
            sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
            personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
            purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other
            requirements.</p>
        <h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data as
            follows:</p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Request access</span> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject
            access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check
            that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Request correction</span> of the personal data that we hold about you. This
            enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
            verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Request erasure</span> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
            delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
            the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right
            to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
            required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able
            to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
            applicable, at the time of your request. </p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Object to processing</span> of your personal data where we are relying on a
            legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which
            makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
            freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
            purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
            information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Request restriction of processing</span> of your personal data. This enables you
            to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
            <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
            <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
                or defend legal claims.
            </li>
            <li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
                grounds to use it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="legal-concept">Request the transfer</span> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We
            will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
            machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially
            provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Withdraw consent at any time</span> where we are relying on consent to process
            your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
            withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or
            services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>
        <h3>No fee usually required</h3>
        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
            However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
            Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
        <h3>What we may need from you</h3>
        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
            to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
            that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
            ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
        <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a
            month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
            notify you and keep you updated. </p>

        <h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Legitimate Interest</span> means the interest of our business in conducting and
            managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure
            experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative)
            and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your
            personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your
            consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we
            assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by
            contacting us.</p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Performance of Contract</span> means processing your data where it is necessary
            for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering
            into such a contract.</p>
        <p><span class="legal-concept">Comply with a legal obligation</span> means processing your personal data where
            it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>
